Summary
-------

`tidal-bootstrap` is small shell script which attempts to ease the
installation process of the [TidalCycles](http://tidalcycles.org/)
programming environment under Mac OS X.

The script checks if the following programs are installed on the system, and installs them if they are missing.

* Atom (and the TidalCycles plugin)
* ghci (ghcup)
* The [Tidal library](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/tidal)
